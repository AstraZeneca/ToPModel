**Simulated data**

Uncompress simdata.zip to obtain simdata.csv. This provides simulated participant level data to fit a ToP model similar to the manuscript.

Variables in simdata.csv:

- id = participant ID

- z = 1 if received treatment, else 0
- start, stop = daily at-risk intervals relative to time since dose

- ev = 1 if participant had an event between [start, stop] days after dose, else 0

- conc = daily serum mAb concentration (Î¼g/mL) predicted from pop-PK

- wtg = prevalence-adjusted IC50 (ng/mL)

- wtg_nab = prevalence-adjusted nAb titre, calculated as (conc*1000)/wtg

- wtg_lnab = log10(wtg_nab+1)

**ToPModel.sas**

SAS code to fit the ToP model to simdata.csv and generate efficacy point estimates and bootstrapped two-sided 90% confidence intervals. Developed using SAS 9.4. Set macro variables on lines 1-2 as described. In the below example NBOOT is set to 10.

 	%let NBOOT = <SET TO NUMBER OF BOOTSTRAP REPLICATES. CAN BE SET TO SMALLER NUMBER (E.G. 10) FOR QUICK RUN TIME.>;
